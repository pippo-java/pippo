It's an open source (Apache license) micro web framework in Java, with minimal dependencies and a quick learning curve.     
The goal of this project is to create a micro web framework in Java that should be easy to use and hack.      
The concept it's not new (I was inspired by Sinatra, Express JS, Play Framework) but my intention is to provide a clean, easy to use and modular solution. Pippo can be used in small and medium applications and also in applications based on micro services architecture.   
I believe in simplicity and I will try to develop this framework with these words in mind.  

The core is small (around 100k) and I intend to keep this module as small/simple as possible and to push new functionalities in pippo modules and third-party repositories/modules.

The framework is based on Java Servlet 3.0 and requires Java 7.
